* Release 0.6 is available -- supporting multiple dbs now.

    * The release allows dmucs to support multiple databases of compilation 
      hosts -- grouped however the administrator decides. One common usage 
      is to group by architecture, so that 'sunos' compilation hosts are in 
      one database, 'linux' are in another, and 'freebsd' are in another, 
      e.g. Use -t arguments to "loadavg" and "gethost" to enable this 
      functionality.
