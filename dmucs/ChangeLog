0.1 -- Initial release.

0.2 -- Thanks to Patrik Olesen for code to eliminate most pthread forks,
       and for the -H option to the server to point to the hosts-info file.
    -- made a few changes to store resolve IP names in the DmucsHost object.

0.3 -- Look for hosts-info in the $pkgdatadir now -- usually
       /usr/local/share/dmucs/hosts-info.
    -- Expect the administrator to specify
	CPPFLAGS=-DSERVER_MACH_NAME=\\\"<machname>\\\" when running
       'configure'.  This specifies where the dmucs host-server will be run.
       With this change, you don't have to specify -s to all the executables
       (loadavg, gethost, monitor, etc.)

0.4 -- Better yet: the administrator should add the CPPFLAGS thing above
       to the gmake command -- this works for me on both solaris and linux.
       Added a message to be printed out when a new host is added.
       Cleaned up the host name resolution stuff -- all in one file now.
       Thanks for Patrik Olesen for his help.
